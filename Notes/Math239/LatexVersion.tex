\item
  Handshake Theorem: $\sum_{v \in V(G)} deg(v) = 2|E|$
\item
  Proposition: Every graph with $\geq 2$ vertices has \textbf{two
  vertices} of the \textbf{same degree.}
\item
  Proposition: the n-cube has $2^n$ vertices and $n2^{n-1}$ edges
\item
  Theorem: if there is a walk from vertex x to vertex y in G then there
  is a path from x to y in G.
\item
  Corollary: if there is a path from x to y in G and a path from y to z
  in G then there is a path from x to z in G.
\item
  Theorem: let G be a graph and let v be a vertex in G. If for each w in
  G there is a path from v to w, then G is connected. \emph{For any
  vertex, you can get to any other vertex.}
\item
  Theorem: a graph G is \textbf{not connected} iff there exists a proper
  subset of x of V(G) such that the \textbf{cut} induced by x is empty.
\item
  Proposition: if every very has degree $\geq 2$ then G \textbf{has a
  cycle}.
\item
  Theorem (Dirac): if G is a graph on \textbf{n \textgreater{} 3
  vertices} where every vertex has degree $\geq \frac{n}{2}$, then G has
  a cycle containing every vertex. G is a \textbf{Hamiltonian Graph}.
\item
  Theorem (Chvtal '72): if G is a graph on n vertices with degree
  $d_1 \leq d_2 \leq d_3 ... \leq d_n$ then if $d_i \geq i$ or
  $d_{n-i} \geq n - i$ for all $i \leq \frac{n}{2}$, then G is
  Hamiltonian.
\item
  Theorem (Tutte): Every \textbf{4-connected} planar graph is
  \textbf{Hamiltonian}.
\item
  Theorem: Every connected graph in which every vertex has even degree
  is \emph{Eulerian}. An Eulerian graph has an Euler tour, which is a
  closed walk that contains every edge once.
\item
  Lemma: if e = \{x,y\} is a bridge of a connected graph G, then G-e has
  precisely two components. Furthermore, x and y are in different
  components.
\item
  Theorem: An edge is a bridge of a graph G iff it is \textbf{not
  contained in a cycle of G}.
\item
  Corollary: If there are two distinct paths from u to v in G then G
  contains a cycle.
\item
  Lemma: There is a unique path between every pair of vertices u and v
  in a tree.
\item
  Lemma: \textbf{Every edge} of a tree T is a \textbf{bridge}.
\item
  Theorem: A tree with \textbf{at least 2 vertices} has at least two
  vertices of \textbf{degree 1}.
\item
  Theorem: if T is a tree, then \textbar{}E(T)\textbar{} =
  \textbar{}V(T) - 1\textbar{}.
\item
  Proposition: If x,y are vertices of a tree T, then there is a unique
  path of T from x to y.
\item
  Proposition: A graph G has a \textbf{spanning tree} iff it is
  \textbf{connected}.
\item
  Corollary: Every connected graph on n vertices has $\geq n-1$ edges.
\item
  Corollary: Every \textbf{connected} graph on n vertices, n-1 edges
  \textbf{is a tree}.
\item
  Proposition: Every tree is \textbf{bipartite}.
\item
  Proposition: If G is a bipartite graph and u,v $\in V(G)$ then if u
  and v are in the \textbf{same part} of a bipartition, then every walk
  from u to v has \textbf{even length}. If u,v are in \textbf{different
  parts}, then every walk from u to v has \textbf{odd length}.
\item
  Proposition: If G is a graph with no \textbf{odd cycles}, then
  \textbf{G is bipartite}.
\item
  Theorem: Prim's algorithm outputs a min-weight spanning tree.
\item
  Proposition: A graph is planar iff it has a spherical embedding.
\item
  Theorem: If a connected planar embedding has faces $f_1, f_2, ...$
  then $\sum_{i=1} deg(f_i) = 2|E(G)|$
\item
  Corollary: If the connected graph G has a planar embedding with f
  faces, then average degree of a face is $\frac{2|E(G)|}{f}$.
\item
  Theorem (Euler): let G be a connected graph with \textbar{}V\textbar{}
  vertices and \textbar{}E\textbar{} edges. If G has a planar embedding
  with \textbar{}F\textbar{} faces, then \textbar{}V\textbar{} -
  \textbar{}E\textbar{} + \textbar{}F\textbar{} = 2.

  \{3,4\}, \{4,3\}, \{5,3\}, \{3,5\}
\item
  Lemma: If G is \textbf{connected} and \textbf{not a tree} then in a
  planar embedding of G, the boundary of each face contains a
  \textbf{cycle}.
\item
  Lemma: Let G be a planar embedding with \textbar{}V\textbar{} vertices
  and \textbar{}E\textbar{} edges. If each face has degree at least d,
  then (d-2)\textbar{}E\textbar{} $\leq$ d(\textbar{}V\textbar{}-2)\$.

  edges}, \textbf{each face} has degree $\geq 3$.
\item

  cycle}, the \textbf{boundary} of every face \textbf{contains a cycle}.
\item
  Lemma (Test 1): If G = (V,E) is a planar graph and
  \textbar{}E\textbar{} $\geq 2$, then \textbar{}E\textbar{} $\leq$
  3\textbar{}V\textbar{}-6.
\item
  Corollary: $K_5$ is non-planar \textbar{}V\textbar{} = 5,
  \textbar{}E\textbar{} = 10.
\item
  Corollary: A \textbf{planar graph} has a \emph{vertex of degree at
  most 5}.
\item
  Lemma (Test 2): If G = (V,E) is a planar graph and every cycle has
  length $\geq$ g, where g is the \textbf{girth}, the length of the
  smallest cycle, and \textbar{}E\textbar{} $\geq \frac{1}{2}g$, then
  $|E| \leq \frac{g}{g-2}(|V| - 2)$
\item
  Corollary: $K_{3,3}$ is non-planar because it has no triangles, so g =
  4 and it fails Test 2.

  \textbar{}C\textbar{} then M is a maximum matching and C is a minimum
  cover.
\item

  of the \textbf{maximum matching} is \textbf{equal} to the size of the
  \textbf{minimum cover}.
\item
  Lemma: Let G be a \textbf{bipartite} graph with bipartition A,B where
  \textbar{}A\textbar{} = \textbar{}B\textbar{} = n. If G has
  \textbar{}E\textbar{} edges then \textbf{G has a matching} of
  \textbf{at least} size $\frac{|E|}{n}$.
\item
  Theorem (Hall's): An (A,B)-bigraph G has a matching that
  \textbf{saturates} A iff for \textbf{every subset} S of A,
