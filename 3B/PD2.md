# Knowing your rights as a User
Words with friends is a game produced by Zynga that looks very similar to Scrabble.

It is a derivative work, a new creation that makes use of existing works. Derivative works include novel and useful improvements on inventions.

In general, a derivative work is any creation that includes elements from one or more pre-existing works, each of which might have its own IP protection; the existing works might be used as is or might be adapted.

The new content in a derivative work is itself considered intellectual property and is entitled to its own copyright protection.

Thus, improved inventions, if the improvements are sufficiently novel and nonobvious, can themselves be protected by their own patent.

## Mashups
A popular type of derivative work that is derived almost entirely from a combination of existing works.

The originality of the mashup stems from a) the creator’s selections from existing works and b) the novel ways in which the selections are combined. 

In the same way that a collage is an artwork made from an assortment of photographs, clippings, and drawings, a mashup is a new work that is created by combining and overlaying an assortment of existing works.

A music mashup is a new song that is created by combining tracks from multiple pre-recorded songs.

A video mashup is, analogously, a new video that is created by combining, morphing, and augmenting snippets from multiple pre-released videos. 

As you might imagine, lots of new creative works are actually derivative works that reuse, build on, or reinterpret existing works. If you create a derivative work that makes use of an original work that is protected by copyright or patent or some other type of IP protection, then you are legally obliged to seek permission from the copyright holder to use the existing work; and you will likely pay a royalty or license fee. This practice is prevalent in the music and film industry. 

Because The Beatles do not own the copyrights to their own songs, the surviving members of The Beatles – Paul McCartney and Ringo Star – have to pay royalties to the copyright holder every time they play a Beatles’ song in concert.

The Copyright Act explicitly lists a number of such exceptions by which users can access and make use of copyrighted work without needing to obtain the consent of the copyright holder or to pay a licensing fee.

There are two aspects used to decide whether a particular use of copyrighted material falls under the exception of **Fair Dealing**: A) the purpose of using the copyrighted work, and B) whether the degree of use is fair to the creator.

To be considered Fair Dealing, the use of a copyrighted work must belong to the list of approved uses, which includes: personal study, research, criticism (such as a critical response to a published opinion article), review, news reporting, education (including making multiple copies of the work for classroom use), parody, or satire. 

In the past, ways to determine whether you are being fair to the creator have been related to:

How many copies of the original work are being made, and how widely they are being distributed? If only a few copies are made, and they are destroyed after their use, then it is easier to conclude that the dealing is fair. An example of fair dealing is allowing a consumer to preview a song before purchasing it, and ensuring that the preview copy is destroyed after being heard.

How much of the original work is being copied? With respect to this factor, the courts tend to care more if the copied portion is qualitatively an important part of the original work, rather than if the copied portion is quantitatively a large percentage of the original work.

Is the use of copyrighted work necessary, or are there other alternative sources that are not copyrighted?

An important factor is whether the derived work adversely affects the market for the original work – either by competing with the original work, or by defaming it.

## Looking Back at Words with Friends
Rules of games are not copyrightable, so that is in WWF's favour. Instructions in general, including recipes are not copyrightable, like Coke's secret formula.

Since Zynga rewrote the rules in different words but to the same effect, they are not violating the copyright.

Even though the board has the same double and triple score squares, these squares are all necessary to the rules of the game. Since the rules are not copyrightable, and the squares are needed for the rules, then having the board with squares like this is under fair dealing.

The placement of the bonus tiles, the colour of them and the font are all also different enough to avoid copyright issues.

The games have different numbers of tiles and point values. While the ideas surrounding the game and the rules of the game are very similar, ideas and rules are not copyrightable.

## Use of the Shining in Roam 237
Bulk of the movie is long commentaries on the Shining. While they never asked permission from the copyright holders, the documentary claimed it was a critique of the original film, and therefore was allowable under fair dealings.

The voiceovers offered unique content, and the documentary did not conflict with the market for the Shining.

## Fair Use vs Fair Dealing
Fair Dealing is commonly found in Commonwealth countries. Fair Use is a copyright exception that applies in the States and a few other countries. The set of uses of copyright material is NOT predetermined. The US Copyright Law lists a number of possible uses of a copyright work, such as criticism, commentary, teaching, etc, but the list is illustrative rather than definitive.

The determination of whether a particular use is fair is based solely on the details of the case, such as whether the derivative work is highly transformative compared to the original or whether it had a negative effect on the market for the original.

## User-Generated Content Exception
A second type of copyright exception, also called Users' Rights. The Canadian Copyright Act explicitly allows the use of copyrighted work in the creation of a new non-commercial work as long as the original work is properly attributed and the original does not infringe on any rights, and as long as the new work is non-commercial and does not affect the market for the original.

The goal of User-Generated Content Exceptions is to allow ordinary people to create derivative works for non-commercial purposes. Think of photoshopped images, homemade remixes of music, home videos with famous background music on YouTube, the user is expected to be an individual and a hobbyist.

Sometimes musicians make white label samples of their songs that are not sold and not mass produced to test with people before deciding to pay expensive copyright fees for using the content of some other songs.

These promotional recordings are a necessary evil that promote the creation of derivative songs.

Performing remixed songs by DJ's in clubs is legal because the bar typically pays the royalties for the performances of copyrighted material.

If a DJ then sells recordings of his remixes, even if the numbers are small, he must pay royalties.

Fan works are determined on a case-by-case basis. Characters and plots of fictional stories can be creative, integral elements of an original work and copyright holders of fictional works are often the sole parties able to distribute derivative works involving their characters.

Fan works are typically non-commercial works created by hobbyists, however another aspect of copyrights called moral rights is directly relevant to creators' rights to the character and worlds they create.
