# Intellectual Property
creations of human intellect such as industrial, literary, trademarks, logos, software.

IP aims to stimulate the creation of derivative works that extend or draw from existed protected works.

It is about balance between extending existing works and protecting them.

## Rights of Creators:
Exclusive rights to determine how a work is produced/reproduced

## Rights of Public:
Restricted permission to use existing works in the creation of new works.

If you're creating your own works, then you have IP rights:

* Protects right to produce reproduce or imitate original works
* Protects rights to sell, license or distribute copies of the original work
* Make derivative works

Can sue:
* To order an infringer to cease and desist.
* For compensation of lost profits.
* for earnings made by the infringer.

## Copyright
Protects the IP embedded in original works of expression for art, movies, photographs, literary works, dance routines, sheet music.

Copyright protection begins when you create the work in a tangible medium. You don't have to file anything, you are instantly the owner. The catch comes when someone infringes on your work. Before you can ask the government to force them to stop, you must register the copyright with the government. This takes time, so while registering on infringement is fine, it adds cost if you want it done quickly and means it will take longer to stop them, which will cause further damages as they continue to steal your work.

The owner of a copyright has exclusive rights to produce and reproduce the work. Copyright law affects the right to make photocopies, copy work.

For music, copyright affects the right to make photocopies, or recordings or perform the music or create new songs that imitate or take samples from the original music.

## Music Infringement Rights
Courts give more emphasis to what is taken rather than the quantity. Is the copied part a core identifiable part of the work? Copying a few sequences of notes are often identifiable as the original song like in game shows.

Ice Ice Baby is a clear imitation of the song Under Pressure by Queen and David Bowie.

It also uses note sequences identified by the Queen song. Ice claimed that the bass was different because of the addition of one more note.

Copyright infringement is different from plagiarism. Copying is deemed plagiarism if not cited.

Distributing unauthorized copies infringes on copyright, even if properly cited. It is about permission, not citation.

# Copyrights in Canada
Creators hold the copyright of their creation. But IP can be bought, sold, gifted or inherited.

Copyright protection persists for 50 years after death.

The work does not have to be published to be copyrighted. Its expression just needs to be in its near final form. Copyright protection extends automatically to 167 countries so as long as you have 1 copyright it applies to all of those.

The Canadian copyright Act makes the employer the default copyright holder of any work you create.

If you create it on your own time then it is yours unless you agreed to defer your rights to your employer in your employment contract. This can supersede your default rights and make you unable to own any work you create.

# Patents
Protect the IP embedded in inventions.

Physical products, machines, processes and compositions of matter are all patentable.

A type of battery, a new machine to make batteries, a new process to dispose of batteries or new materials to improve battery life are all patentable.

You cannot patent scientific principles or formulae, or ideas like the concept of a battery, or technical papers about batteries, they are protected by copyright laws.

To be patentable the invention must be novel, useful and its creation must have required ingenuity. It cannot be overly obvious.

It can improve something else as long as it is **novel, useful and non-obvious.**

In Canada, patents are granted to the first inventor to file an application. The way you establish ownership of an invention is filing an application.

It ends 20 years after the filing of the application and begins at after approval. It only applies in the country filed and must be filed in each country where it is desired to be protected.

## Protecting Software
Software is deemed a literary work that is protected by copyright since it is viewed as a creation of expression.

The source code is a literary work and the user interface is an audio/video/graphical work.

Software is not like other created works, it is not in how it is expressed, it is its functionality. But copyrighting is only protecting the source code, not the functionality.

Software and hardware are essentially interchangeable. Then the work would be considered a machine and protected under patent law. So can patent law protect software?

Maybe.

In the early days of software, it was not patentable. Patents cannot protect mathematical ideas or formulae, but in the 80s the US supreme court granted patents to to software in cases where the software played a critical role in a larger invention.

Thereafter, companies claimed patentability of software by tying it to a larger composition like the hardware processor, or a larger business process like financial processes.

Courts have reverted to viewing software programs as abstract algorithms and ideas. Current views of the patentability of software are mixed and court rulings can be unpredictable.

2/3 of Startups did not get patents for their software because of the cost and the unpatentability of the invention. The patent protection was deemed to be less important than copyright.

## Copyright Protection
Today, software is protected mostly by copyrights, which ensure that the literal copying of source code and its interface are not used inappropriately.

It also goes beyond literal copying and includes cases where works are similar enough that the first can be reproduced in the second. Courts have a test to determine if the creative design decisions in two programs are the same. They are identified at different levels of abstraction.

The design of data structures, modules, algorithms, and the graphical interface.

Any design decisions that are obvious or constrained are excluded like the use of standard data structures or graphics that are not artistic, or coding decisions that are dictated by external factors like the hardware, or coding decisions that are restricted because of security or efficiency constraints or common means of displaying info like modals or dropdowns.

These are not creative or expressive and are not copyrightable.

Protection against non-literal copying has been extended to other works like films and novels. Infringement includes creating imitations that are strikingly similar and considered infringement.

Example:

A programmer wrote two different applications Sysview at Delrina and Assess at a different company from scratch, both of which monitors the performance of a particular HP computer.

Delrina sued for copyright infringement and lost. The trial judge both ruled against Delrina because the various elements in the program were either not copied or copyrightable. All of the similarities were either necessary for the general functionality or dictated by the platform, there was no other way to communicate with the HP computer. Or reflected common programming practices.

The code common to both was not original and therefore not protected by copyright.

## Trade Secrets
A trade secret is some IP that gives its owner an advantage over competitors. Coca Cola has a secret recipe for its drink that it has kept for much longer than copyright or patents provide.

It must have value to its owner or competitor and not be available outside the company. The owner must be taking proactive measures to restrict the secret and ensure that those with access sign an NDA.

If an employee accidentally exposes a trade secret, it is difficult to prosecute if they claim they did so accidentally.

## Trade Secrets in Software
Not effective in source code. Decompilation can get the source from object code. But plans, designs, documentation are often protected as trade secrets.

Most software is protected by trade secrets and copyright. If they do get access to your trade secret, they often can't use it because it is protected by copyright.
